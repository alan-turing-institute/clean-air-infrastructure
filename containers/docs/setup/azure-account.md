# Azure account

To contribute to the Turing deployment of this project you will need to be on the Turing Institute's Azure active directory. In other words you will need a turing email address `<someone>@turing.ac.uk`. If you do not have one already contact an [infrastructure administrator](#contributors-:dancers:).

If you are deploying the CleanAir infrastrucure elsewhere you should have access to an Azure account (the cloud-computing platform where the infrastructure is deployed).
